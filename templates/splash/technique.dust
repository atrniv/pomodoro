<h3>The Technique</h3>
<p>The Pomodoro Technique &reg; is a very simple and effective time management technique. Created in the 1980s by Francesco Cirillo, the technique helps you accomplish your aims by changing the way you use your time.</p>

<p>In the technique, you only work in short bursts of 25-minutes, separated by 5-minute breaks. This work-break cycle is called a <em>pomodoro</em>.</p>

<p>The technique is named after the tomato-shaped kitchen clock Francesco had when he started.</p>

<p>By the way, in Italian, <em>pomodoro = tomato</em>, and <em>pomidoro</em> being the plural.</p>
